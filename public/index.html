      content="Hi! I'm Audrey. I am eager to learn: about the user, new products, new services, new technologies, new cookie recipes, new places to travel! With UX my goal is to make a workflow more fluid, simple, and intuitive by understanding the user -- turning the complex into simple, beautiful user experiences.

      I am passionate about crafting easier and more enjoyable user experiences. My background combines a degree in graphic design, managing experience at a 5-star resort, real estate photography plus front-end development. This allows me to bring a greater depth of knowledge to a product design team. I'm currently focusing on expanding my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.
      
      I was born and raised in Texas but have been residing in Nashville, TN for over ten years. I am ready to work remotely for a company based anywhere in the world. I'm a lover of coffee, chocolate, cookies, art, and landscape photography."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
